# Confessions of a DevOps Novice 👨‍💻

Hey there fellow human (or sentient AI, I don't discriminate)! 👋 Welcome to my humble abode on GitHub, where chaos meets code, and where I, a young DevOps engineer, embark on the treacherous journey of understanding the enigma wrapped in a Kubernetes cluster.

## 🤔 Who Am I?

I'm just your average dev navigating through the labyrinth of containers, clouds, and configs. Often found muttering sweet nothings to my Ubuntu terminal, trying to decipher the cryptic language of ELK logs, wrestling with regex patterns that seem to have a life of their own, and occasionally seeking solace in the comforting embrace of Vault. Oh, and did I mention my ongoing love-hate relationship with Ansible?
